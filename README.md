Nail_It
=======

Nail_It is a program that can take the majority of images and make high quality thumbnail shrinks

Using Nail_It
===================

Browse to the folder containing all the images you want to shrink, then browse to where you want to save the 
output thumbnails. Adjust the target width and height as desired then hit Execute! DONE! 

=========================
Future Updates
=========================
-Make a compatible gui for single selection.  I made this to do a huge amount of images at one time so this simple feature
was never implemented. When I have the time I will add it in for sake of completeness
